The temperature in Chennai exists somewhere
between 280C to 330C in a particular



week. The temperature in Delhi is 80C
lesser than in Chennai. Likewise, the



temperature in Haveri is 50C more than that
of Chennai. Write a C program to find the



temperature of Gangtok for a particular
week, which is the temperature difference



between Delhi and Haveri. Get the
temperature of Chennai (0C) as input for the week



of 7 days and the temperature of Gangtok
(0C) as output for the week of 7 days.



Implement the program using arrays and validate
the rules
